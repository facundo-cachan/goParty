## About this App

*This app hoped to be the event organization tool for those who had the role of PR. In which he could manage the events they organize, advertise them, and the places.*
*It would also function as a social network, since registered users could see who among their contacts would attend the events.*
*The app would allow obtaining analytics in 2 different areas:
1st, about the event, attendance, likes, comments, only for those who attended the event.
2nd, on the place, regardless of the event held.*
